The book builds upon what students have already learned and emphasizes connections between topics as well as between theory and applications.

The contributors to and dangers of socioeconomic inequality are fully addressed, and the role of inequality in social dysfunction, disruption, and change is noted.</p><p data-block-key=""9ciut"">If you have encountered a white screen while accessing your OpenStax textbook, our developers suggest closing all of your <a href=""http://openstax.org/"">OpenStax.org</a> tabs and then loading the book again.</p>"

To meet this goal, the text creates a reciprocal relationship between everyday rhetoric and the evolving world of academia. <i>Writing Guide with Handbook</i> builds on students’ life experiences and their participation in rhetorical communities within the familiar contexts of personal interaction and social media.
